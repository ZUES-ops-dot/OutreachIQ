# OutreachIQ
> High-performance email lead generation engine built in Rust

## Key Features
- Parallel domain scraping with async I/O (Tokio)
- Email validation pipeline (syntax → DNS → SMTP)
- Rate-limited API integration (LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Hunter.io)
- CSV export with custom segmentation filters

## Performance
- Processes 10K leads/hour on single-core VPS
- 94% email deliverability rate (verified via NeverBounce)

## Tech Stack
Rust (reqwest, tokio, serde) • PostgreSQL • Redis cache

Signal-Based Lead Generation & Cold Outreach Platform built with Rust backend and Next.js frontend.

## Features

- **Multi-Tenant Architecture** - Secure workspace isolation for multiple customers
- **JWT Authentication** - Role-based access control (owner, admin, member, viewer)
- **Real Email Sending** - SMTP integration with encrypted credentials
- **Inbox Warmup** - Gradual volume increase to protect domain reputation
- **Compliance Built-in** - One-click unsubscribe, suppression lists
- **Usage Tracking** - Per-workspace limits and billing integration
- **Stripe Payments** - Subscription management with webhooks

## Core Philosophy

- **Fresh over Size**: Generate leads on-demand, not from stale databases
- **Signal-Driven**: Track buying intent signals (hiring, funding, tech changes)
- **Deliverability First**: Built-in warmup, verification, and reputation management
- **Vertical Focus**: Start with 3 deep verticals (SaaS, Web3, Agency)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75+
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker (optional)

### Using Docker

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts:
- PostgreSQL on port 5432
- Backend API on port 8080
- Frontend on port 3000

### Manual Setup

1. **Start PostgreSQL**

```bash
# Create database
createdb outreachiq
```

2. **Backend**

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database URL

cargo run
```

3. **Frontend**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
